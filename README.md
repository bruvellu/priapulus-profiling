Gene expression profiling of priapulid development
==================================================

**Objective:** characterize differentially expressed genes during the
development of a priapulid worm using RNAseq data. [Read

**Progress:**
- Fixed Fritzen's installation quirks for Agalma.
- Assembled new reference with Agalma 0.3.5.
- Prepared data, calculated read counts, replicate plots.
- Generated STEM profiles.
- Ran differential expression analysis and got significant change in expression
  for many genes that correlate with developmental events.
- Started playing with visualizing the data.

**Plan:**
- Consolidate data analyses and differentially expressed genes.
    - Review RNAseq literature and get to know all the caveats of RNAseq and
      differential expression analyses.
    - Thoroughly understand the statistical strength and weaknesses of the data,
      including all implicit assumptions.
    - Delineate the assumptions of the data and how the differential expression test
      is being executed.
    - Try different DE methods.
- Annotate genes with Gene Ontology and merge with results.
- Select relevant developmental pathways and describe gene activity.
- Explore the possibility of comparing with data sets of other species.
- Think about data visualization.
