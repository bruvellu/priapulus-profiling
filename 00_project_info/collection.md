# Collection & Sampling

We collected adult priapulids by dredging at the Sven Lovén Marine Station in
Kristineberg, Sweden. Two large females with ripe gonads were selected for the
experiment. We shaked dissected gonads to obtain eggs which we then fertilized
using a sperm mix of different males. Cultures were kept at 10 °C. Every day we
picked at least 1000 good-looking embryos (usually more) and added directly to
a tube with RNAlater.

Female 1 (F1) was spawned at the station in Sweden. Female 2 (F2) was brought
to the Sars Centre in Bergen, Norway and spawned at the same conditions.

The stages sampled for each female are shown below.
