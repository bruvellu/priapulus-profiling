# Dynamics of gene expression in the development of the penis worm _Priapulus caudatus_


_Priapulus caudatus_ is a mud-dwelling marine predator best known as the _penis
worm_. Priapulids have a key phylogenetic position in the animal tree of life.
They belong to the Ecdysozoa – the animals that molt – together with the
arthropods and nematode worms. We know in exceptional detail how flies and
nematodes develop, but surprisingly little about the gene activity in the
priapulid embryo, and how it compares to other ecdysozoans. Here we
characterize the developmental dynamics of gene expression in _P. caudatus_
using RNA-seq data, and compare to the gene activity in _Drosophila
melanogaster_ and _Caenorhabditis elegans_ embryogenesis, to better understand
the evolution of ecdysozoan development.
